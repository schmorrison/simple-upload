# Simple Upload

This is just a very simple utility to enable uploading/downloading files through a browser to/from the directory the program was started in. Imagine this as the Python "simpleHTTPServer" command, but providing a method to upload files.

THIS IS NOT FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
